# Exploratory Data Analysis

The programmnig language I used was R and I used R Studio to conduct the analysis.

## Introduction

In order to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), I choose to use the dataset about sleep efficiency, which has some missing data. I will be explaining why I choose to use certain EDA methods and what results I find. Moreover, I will detect whether there exists some outliers in the dataset. If there are some outliers, I will explain how I will deal with them. Last but not least, I will discuss some possible questions to be investigated for future studies.

## The Key Elements of EDA
1. Handling Missing Data
2. Outlier Detection
3. Data Summarization
4. Data Visualization
5. Correlation Analysis

## Process
### 1. Handling Missing Data
#### Finding unique characters.
